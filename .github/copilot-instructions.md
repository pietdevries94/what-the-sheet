# Agent validation instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Always validate your work before completing any task by running the following commands:

1. **Run tests**: `pnpm run test`
   - Executes the test suite using vitest
   - Ensures all functionality works as expected

2. **Run checks**: `pnpm run check`
   - Runs ESLint with auto-fix to catch and fix code quality issues
   - Runs Prettier to format code consistently
   - Ensures code follows project standards

These validation steps are mandatory for maintaining code quality and should be run after making any code changes.
